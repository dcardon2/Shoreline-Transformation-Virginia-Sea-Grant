### Introduction 
Global climate change has led to many adverse impacts including changing weather patterns and an increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events. Traditional hard engineering solutions for coastal protection, such as seawalls and bulkheads, are becoming inadequate as they do not have the capacity to keep pace with the accelerating impacts of climate change.In response, there is growing interest in Natural and Nature-Based Features (NNBF), which offer innovative and adaptive approaches to coastal protection. NNBFs, such as salt marshes or living shorelines, have demonstrated potential for mitigating wave energy, reducing flood risks, and enhancing coastal resilience. However, the effectiveness of these features can vary based on their physical attributes and the specific environmental conditions in which they are implemented. The inconsistent performance of NNBFs has posed challenges for their widespread adoption, partly due to uncertainties in their efficacy and barriers in public policy. 

This research focuses on evaluating the performance of NNBFs in attenuating waves through innovative field-scale prototypes and the natural environment. Here we aim to deepen our understanding of how these interventions can contribute to enhancing coastal resilience. 
### Project Overview 
This project is sponsored by Virginia Sea Grant and aims to evaluate the performance of Natural and Nature-Based Features (NNBF) in attenuating waves and enhancing coastal resilience. One deliverable produced by this project is the poster presented at AGU24, which provides a comprehensive overview of the research findings. 
### Repository Structure 
-  **VASG_canal_final.html**: This Jupyter notebook contains the graphs and figures generated for the 'controlled' condition as noted in the poster. It includes data analysis and visualizations related to the Whittaker Creek Canal. Please download this file for best visualization.
-  **VASG_marsh_final.html**: This Jupyter notebook (currently named 'draft_marsh.ipynb') will be updated with the final code and analysis for the 'exposed' condition, focusing on the Severn River Shoreline site. 
-  **draft_for_VASG.ipynb**: This file serves as the base for all the code used to make figures and pull data for the project.
 ### Poster Description
The poster titled "Shoreline Transformation: Forward-Looking Nature-Based Adaptation Strategies" presents research on the efficacy of NNBFs in coastal protection. It includes:
- **Controlled Conditions**: Describes field experiments conducted before and after the installation of NNBFs, including data collection methods and results.
- **Exposed Conditions**: Details the deployment of wave loggers and the analysis of wave events in different transects.
- **Figures and Photos**: Visual representations of the study sites, experimental setups, and data analysis results.
